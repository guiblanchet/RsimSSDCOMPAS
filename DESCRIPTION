Description: This package contains three main functions. 1) SimSSDR takes the size of a square grid, variograms characteristics and a type of deterministic structure and returns simulated environment and species data on that particular grid. 2) Rcompas generates species with a generalized beta distribution along a given gradient, following closely COMPAS and JCOMPAS. 3) SimPartial function simulates a covariate vector that is correlated (correlation coefficient given by the user) to a provided gradient and subsequently adds the covariable's additive effect to a provided species data matrix.
